Author's Techniques:

It appears there might be a misunderstanding with the terms "forecast" and "backslash." If "forecast" is intended as foreshadowing and "backslash" as flashback, then:
1. Foreshadowing: Captain Nemo's detailed explanation of the Nautilus's power system foreshadows future events related to this topic. This serves to build suspense and prepare the reader for upcoming plot developments.
2. Flashback: There doesn't appear to be any flashbacks in this chapter. The narrative stays present and focused on the dialogue between Captain Nemo and Professor Aronnax.

Literary Tropes:

1. Infodump: Captain Nemo provides exhaustive details about the Nautilus's instruments, structure, and power source, serving as a method for the author to convey significant information about the novel's setting and technology.
2. Framing Device: The dialogue between Professor Aronnax and Captain Nemo serves as a framing device to explain the scientific and theoretical aspects of the story to the reader.

Narrative Perspective:

The perspective in this chapter remains consistent â€“ it is told from the point of view of Professor Aronnax. The narrative follows his thoughts, observations, and interactions with Captain Nemo throughout the setting exploration and technical explanations.
