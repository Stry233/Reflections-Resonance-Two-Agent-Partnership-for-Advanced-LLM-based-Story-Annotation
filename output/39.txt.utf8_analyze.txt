Story's Beginning:

- The crew are trapped within the icy walls of the Ice Bank, facing potential death through either crushing or asphyxiation.

P1(has(Ice Bank, impenetrable frozen walls)).
P2(areTrapped(Crew, Ice Bank)).

Event Breakdown:

1. The crew realizes they're trapped within an Ice Bank and faces potential death via crushing or asphyxiation.

2. Captain Nemo decides to use picks to dig through the ice, and when this is too slow, decides to attempt to crush through it using the Nautilus.

3. Crew members take turns breathing from dwindling air tanks while working to free the Nautilus from its ice trap. Struggling with the diminishing air supply on board, Captain Nemo creates and implements a plan to heat the water around the Nautilus to prevent the surrounding ice from solidifying and further trapping them.

4. Despite the crew's best efforts and Captain Nemo's plan, they find themselves with an almost completely depleted air supply.

5. In a final desperate attempt, the Nautilus is aimed to strike through the icy surface blocking them from fresh air.

6. The Nautilus successfully bursts through the icy surface, and fresh air is introduced into the vessel, saving the crew from asphyxiation.

Author's Techniques:

"Forecast" and "backslash": The author seems to use the term "forecast" to present possible dire outcomes or threats, helping to build tension and prepare readers for future developments. Meanwhile, the term "backslash" does not appear in the passage, which might be a misunderstanding. If the term "flashback" was intended, it refers to sections where past events are recollected to provide context or depth to the situation. In this chapter, there aren't any evident flashbacks.

Literary Tropes:

- Man vs. Nature: This well-known trope in literature, where the characters are at odds with natural forces, is evident in the crew's struggle against the inimical icy environment.

- Survival: This is another prevalent theme here, with the crewmember's desperate attempts to avoid fatal asphyxiation and the physical extremes they endure to secure survival.

- Hope Amid Despair: Despite facing certain asphyxiation, the crew holds onto hope and try different salvation solutions, which rejuvenates both their spirit and will to survive.

Narrative Perspective:

The story seems to be told from a first-person perspective, from the protagonist Professor Aronnax's viewpoint. The narrative perspective is consistent throughout, demonstrating Aronnax's thoughts, experiences, and responses to the situations faced by the crew, which allows the reader to experience events and emotions along with him.
