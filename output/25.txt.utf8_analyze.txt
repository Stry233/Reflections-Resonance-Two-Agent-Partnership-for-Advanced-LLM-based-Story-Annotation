**Author's Techniques:**

The term "forecast" and "backslash" seem to be typo or non-literary terms. Without context of such use in the text, it's impossible to investigate these terms. Similarly, I can't elaborate on the way the author has used the terms as they are not available in this context.

**Literary Tropes:**

The story features several tropes like:

1. `Sea_Adventure_Trope`: Features adventures at sea, dangerous occurrences, and exotic places.
2. `Loyal_Servant_Trope`: Conseil's character represents the loyal servant who follows his master, Professor Aronnax, into danger.
3. `Bold_Hero_Trope`: Ned Land embodies the adventurous and bold hero ready to take on sharks.

**Narrative Perspective:**

In this chapter, there's no change in narrative perspective. The entire story is told from the first-person point-of-view, specifically that of Professor Aronnax.
