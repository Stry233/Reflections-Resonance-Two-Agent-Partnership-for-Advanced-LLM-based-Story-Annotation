Character Descriptions:

- Prof. Aronnax: A logical and patient character, who values careful thought before action. He is a curious and observant individual, who is capable of detailed analysis. He feels increasingly terrified and hopeless to their demanding situation within the submarine.

- Ned Land: A passionate, aggressive, and impulsive character. He is rebellious and less patient when it comes to their confinement. His frustration escalates throughout the chapter, culminating in him physically attacking the steward due to their treatment and starvation.

- Conseil: He is characterized as calm, respectful, and accepting of their fate within the submarine. He serves as a balancing force between the other two characters.

Story's Beginning:

- The chapter begins with the characters waking up after a long sleep. They are still trapped inside the submarine, their prison cell.

3. Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned Land wake up and discuss their situation.

Author's Techniques:

Assuming "forecast" and "backslash" are typographical errors meant to represent "foreshadowing" and "flashback":

- Foreshadowing: The author uses foreshadowing when the characters discuss the possibilities of what their captors might do with them, hinting at future events. For example, Aronnax's contemplation about them being kept as crew members or being dropped in a remote place, foreshadows potential plot developments.
  
- Flashback: There's no significant use of flashback in this chapter.

Literary Tropes:

- Suspense: The author builds suspense by creating a sense of danger and impending action. This is done through Ned Land's increasing frustration and the mystery surrounding their captors' intentions.
  
- Irony: Despite Ned Land's violent outburst and Aronnax's suspicion about their captor being cruel, the voice that confronts them speaks politely in French.

Narrative Perspective:

- The story is told from Aronnax's perspective. This choice allows the reader to delve into his detailed observations and inner thoughts about their situation and companions, fostering a deeper connection with his character. The perspective remains consistent throughout the chapter.
