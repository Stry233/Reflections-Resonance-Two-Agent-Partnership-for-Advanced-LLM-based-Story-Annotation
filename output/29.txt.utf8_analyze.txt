**Author's Techniques:**

The author uses the concept of "Foreshadowing" when Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned discuss their potential escape from the Nautilus, hinting at future attempts of escape. The mysterious delivery of gold creates suspense and arouses curiosity, another form of foreshadowing. Predicate: `foreshadowing(escapeAttempt, goldDelivery)`

"Literary Backflash" is used when Captain Nemo explains the history of the volcanic islands to Aronnax, educating him and the reader. Predicate: `backflash(volcanicIslandsHistory)`

**Literary Tropes:**

1. "Man against the Sea" - The struggle of the three captives against their circumstances in the marine world.

2. "Mysterious benefactor" - Captain Nemo's secret charitable act of sending gold to an unknown recipient.

Each of these tropes contributes to the tension and suspense that sustain the narrative. The "Man against the Sea" trope encapsulates the protagonists' struggle against their surroundings and their enforced captivity. The "Mysterious benefactor" trope deepens the character of Nemo, making him more intriguing and adding depth to the plot.

**Narrative Perspective:**

The story is told from a first-person perspective, specifically from the viewpoint of Professor Aronnax, which effectively conveys his personal experiences, dilemmas, and discoveries on board the Nautilus.
