**Character Descriptions:**

1. `is_seaman(Commander Farragut)`: Commander Farragut is a seasoned seaman.
2. `is_ship_owner(Commander Farragut)`: Commander Farragut owns and commands a frigate named Abraham Lincoln.
3. `believes_in_monster_existence(Commander Farragut)`: Commander Farragut firmly believes in the existence of a sea monster.
4. `is_harpooner(Ned Land)`: Ned Land is a highly skilled Canadian harpooner.
5. `is_believer_in_monster_existence(Ned Land, false)`: Contrary to most of the crew, Ned Land does not believe in the existence of the sea monster.
6. `likes(Ned Land, Professor Aronnax)`: Ned Land takes a liking to Professor Aronnax because of his French nationality.

**Story's Beginning:**

1. `initial_belief(Commander Farragut, Monster Exists)`: At the story's beginning, Commander Farragut strongly believes in the existence of a sea monster and has equipped his ship for the purpose of hunting it.
2. `initial_belief(Ned Land, Monster Does Not Exist)`: Despite being a skilled harpooner, Ned Land is initially skeptical about the existence of the sea monster.

**Event Breakdown:**

1. `encourages_sea_watch(Commander Farragut)`: To find the sea monster, Farragut encourages an active watch of the seas and even offers a monetary reward to the first one to spot the creature.
2. `debate(Ned Land, Professor Aronnax about existence of sea monster)`: Later the story talks about a conversation between Professor Aronnax and Ned Land, where they debate about the existence of the sea monster, with Land expressing his skepticism.

On the certainty of these events, the proper chronological order would be the offering of the reward by Commander Farragut to encourage the crew to keep a watchful eye on the seas, followed by the debate between Ned Land and Professor Aronnax.

**Author's Techniques:**

The instructions mention techniques of "forecast" and "backslash", but those don't appear to be commonly recognized literary techniques and they don't seem to be directly referenced in the given text. Given this, I don't think I can provide predicates detailing the author's use of these under these names without additional clarification of what's meant by "forecast" and "backslash".

**Literary Tropes:**

The tropes identified are:

1. `Man_vs_Nature`: The Crew's quest to find and defeat the sea monster is an example of the Man vs Nature trope.
2. `The_Skeptic`: Ned Land serves as the Skeptic, expressing doubts about the existence of the sea monster despite the fervent belief of most others on board.

**Narrative Perspective:**

The story is told from a first-person perspective - specifically, that of a character who appears to be named Professor Aronnax. Throughout Chapter 4, the point of view remains constant, with Professor Aronnax providing his own thoughts and experiences, as well as directly quoting his interactions with other characters such as Commander Farragut and Ned Land.
