Character Descriptions:

1. Captain Nemo: Featured as a mysterious yet compassionate character, a leader who cares for his men, has a strong connection to the sea, and values the peacefulness it offers. He is described as having an "exhausted" face showing signs of "profound sadness, real chagrin."

2. Professor Aronnax: A scientist who is attentive and observant. He has keen analytical skills and seeks to understand the mysteries surrounding him. He's also a physician, a fact important in this chapter as he tends to a wounded crewman.

3. Ned Land: A harpooner with "penetrating" eyes, restless when there's nothing to harpoon. Shows signs of accommodating behavior unknown from the previous chapters in agreeing to the underwater excursion without a fight.

4. Conseil: The faithful servant of Professor Aronnax, who readily agrees to participate in the underwater walk possibly driven by his curiosity and loyalty.

5. Injured Crewman: A man around forty years old, Anglo-Saxon by appearance, loyal enough to take a blow for another (likely the chief officer).

Story's Beginning:

At the start of the chapter, the narrator, Professor Aronnax, wakes up with no memory of the events of the previous night, uncertain of his circumstances and freedom. He finds himself aboard the Nautilus and later learns that his companions, Ned Land and Conseil, share his lack of memory.

Event Breakdown:

1. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil find themselves back on the Nautilus with no memory of the events from the previous day.

2. The Nautilus cruises on the surface of the ocean, showing no difference from previous observations.

3. Captain Nemo asks Aronnax to provide medical attention to one of his injured men.

4. Aronnax realizes that the injury is severe and the man is beyond saving.

5. An underwater burial is conducted the next day in a coral cemetery.

6. The crew continue their ocean exploration, examining various flora and fauna in the coral reefs.

Author's Techniques:

The term "forecast" and "backslash" are not directly mentioned in this chapter, and without further details or context about what is meant by these terms in this particular setting, I can't provide a precise explanation.

Literary Tropes:

1. Foreshadowing: The mention of Aronnax's medical past, giving us an inkling that his medical skills might be necessary.

2. Pathetic fallacy: The sea is tranquil, reflecting the characters' ignorance of what happened the previous night.

3. Underwater as Unknown Territory: The sea represents a different world, a timeless place where the norms of the surface world do not apply.

Narrative Perspective:

The story is told from the first person narrative perspective of Professor Aronnax. There is, however, an evident split in perspectives between the Captain and Aronnax, particularly in regards to the sea. The Captain sees the sea as the ultimate resting place - serene yet full of life, while Aronnax sees it as a research field full of unknowns waiting to be understood.
