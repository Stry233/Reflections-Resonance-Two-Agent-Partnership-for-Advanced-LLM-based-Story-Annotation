Author's Techniques:

The author uses "foreshadowing" when Professor Aronnax and his crew find themselves stranded upon the metallic object, alluding to its mechanical nature before it's explicitly revealed to be a man-made submarine.

The "backstory" technique is employed to establish context and add depth to the characters. For example, references to the crew's previous experiences and occupations enrich their character descriptions.

Literary Tropes:

1. Man vs. Nature: The narrative portrays a struggle for survival against the mighty sea.
2. Mysterious creature: The initial depiction of the submarine as a sea creature adds to the suspense.
3. Loyal Servant: Conseil's loyalty towards Professor Aronnax is a classic instance of this trope.
4. Dramatic Irony: The audience is aware of the submarine's mechanical nature before the characters, creating suspense.
