**Author's Techniques:**

Backslash isn't a term conventionally used in a literary context, this might be a typo or misunderstanding. If you meant "flashback", the story doesn't seem to contain an explicit instance of it. The term "forecast" indicates foreshadowing, subtle hints of what might happen later in the story. An example could be the continuous anticipation and speculation by the characters about the possibility and consequences of escaping the Nautilus. 

**Literary Tropes:**

1. `Underwater_Adventure` - The concept of exploring a mysterious, underwater world, high in danger and ancient mysteries.
2. `Lost_Civilization` - The discovery of the lost city of Atlantis, a common trope in many adventure stories.
3. `Reluctant_Comrades` - The interplay between Aronnax, Nemo, and Ned speaks to this trope. They're stuck together in the Nautilus despite their contrasting personalities and agendas.

**Narrative Perspective:**

The narrative perspective is the first-person perspective of Professor Aronnax. It is consistent throughout the story and offers an in-depth look at his personal thoughts, emotions, and observations, adding an element of personal bias to the recounting of events.
