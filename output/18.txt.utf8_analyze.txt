**Author's Techniques:**

It's unclear what's meant by "forecast" and "backslash" as these aren't typical literary terms. Possibly, the user meant "flashback" and "foreshadowing". 

*Foreshadowing:* Captain Nemo's comment about desiring a coral grave may be seen as an ominous foreshadowing of his own fate or that of his crew.

*Flashback:* There’s extensive use of flashback employed through the recounting of the story of Commander La Pérouse and his crew.

**Literary Tropes:**

*Allusion:* The author alludes to numerous real-life sea explorations and discoveries (such as Commander La Pérouse’s tragic journey, Captain Dumont d'Urville’s voyage, etc.) to lend authenticity to the narrative.

*Imagery:* The vivid depiction of marine life, sunken ships, and coral formations is a powerful use of imagery.

**Narrative Perspective:**

The narrative remains consistently from the perspective of the Professor, providing a first-person narration of their journey and conversation with Captain Nemo.
