**Author's Techniques:**

* "Forecast" could possibly refer to how the author introduces various technologies and marine-life features before they become significant, thus preparing readers for what is to come. This includes the detailed introduction of the special diving suits and bulbous helmets, and foreshadowing the undersea stroll with detailed descriptions of the weapons, clothing, and environment.

* The term "backslash" is a bit unclear. If it refers to a flashback or backstory, please provide more specific text examples.

**Literary Tropes:**

- The Underwater City: The Nautilus itself acts like an underwater city, equipped with everything its inhabitants need.

- Foil: Ned Land and Captain Nemo act as foils to each other, with Ned's hesitation and disgust towards the underwater conditions contrasting with Nemo's calm expertise and enthusiasm.

- The Explorer's Journey: The characters, particularly Professor Aronnax, are on a classic journey of discovery, encountering and describing new sights, technologies, and creatures.

**Narrative Perspective:**

The story maintains a consistent narrative perspective throughout. It is told from the first-person point of view, specifically that of Professor Aronnax. His observations, thoughts, and feelings drive the narrative. There are no substantial shifts in perspectives or abrupt changes in the storytelling voice.
