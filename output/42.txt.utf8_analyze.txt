**Author's Techniques:**

1. [author_technique(show, not tell)] - The author uses detailed descriptions to help readers visualize the scenario rather than explicitly stating facts.
   
   - Example: The in-depth description of the storm helps the reader visualize the chaos.


2. [author_technique(suspense)] - The author keeps the reader guessing about Captain Nemo's future plans.
   
   - Example: The conversation between Aronnax and Nemo leaves the reader uncertain about their future.

**Literary Tropes:** 

1. [trope(confined_space)] - The Nautilus serves as a confined space, contributing to the growing tension between the characters.
   
   - Example: Ned Land feeling suffocated and wanting freedom.

2. [trope(respect_to_nature)] - The author gives the sea and nature immense respect describing them not only as geographical entities but living characters.

   - Example: The in-depth description of the storm reveals the powerful and unpredictable nature of the sea.

**Narrative Perspective:**

Seems to be consistent throughout the story and is told from the first-person perspective of Aronnax. His views on the unfolding events give the reader a personal sense of the trials and tribulations happening onboard the Nautilus.
