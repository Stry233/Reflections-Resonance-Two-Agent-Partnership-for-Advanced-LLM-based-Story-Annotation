**Author's Techniques**

Your task mentions "forecast" and "backslash". If you meant "foreshadowing" and "flashback", here they are:

Foreshadowing is seen when Captain Nemo is confident that the tides will help free the Nautilus, priming readers to anticipate the event. 

Flashbacks are abundant throughout the chapter, making reference to famous explorers and their voyages to provide context and enhance the narrative.

**Literary Tropes**

Significant literary tropes include 

1. `Man_Vs_Nature`: The crew battles the natural elements, particularly the tides and coral reefs.
2. `Journey_and_Return`: The crew leaves the Nautilus, has an adventure, and is anticipated to return.
3. `Dark_Forest`: The mystery of what lies on the island ahead reflects this trope.

**Narrative Perspective**

The narrative is written in the first person from the perspective of Professor Aronnax. There is no significant change of perspective throughout the chapter.
