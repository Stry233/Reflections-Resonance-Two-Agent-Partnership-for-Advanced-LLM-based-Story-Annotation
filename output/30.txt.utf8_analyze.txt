Author's Techniques:

The author utilizes "forecast" by foreshadowing the bustling life beneath the Mediterranean sea and the various historical and mythical references that color the Mediterranean's narrative. "Backslash" or flashbacks are used to recount the historical significance and tragedies of the Mediterranean, from the ancient ruins to the uncountable shipwrecks. 

Literary Tropes:

1. Foreshadowing - The author hints at the historical significance and dangers of the Mediterranean through references to ancient myths, past shipwrecks, and dangerous seafarers.
2. Hyperbole - The author uses over-exaggeration for dramatic effect, such as describing the sea as a 'genuine battlefield' and comparing the shipwrecks to a 'field of catastrophes'.
3. Metaphor - The author refers to the Mediterranean as a 'lake' compared to the 'vast liquid plains of the Pacific', and the earth becoming a 'cold corpse'.
   
Narrative Perspective:

The narrative keeps a consistent first-person perspective centered around the narrator, providing his thoughts, observations, and knowledge throughout the passage. However, he also includes observations and knowledge contributed by other key characters like Conseil.
