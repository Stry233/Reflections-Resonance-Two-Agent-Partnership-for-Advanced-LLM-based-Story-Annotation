**Character Descriptions:**

- The Narrator: Extremely detail-oriented and knowledgeable in various scientific subjects, fascinated with the underwater world, and loyal to his companions Ned and Conseil.
- Ned Land: Silent and reserved, seems to be mostly interested in physical experience of the journey, survival, and plans for escape.
- Conseil: Enthusiastic, devoted, and willing to risk his own life for the Narrator. Despite his occasional stumbling with formal speech, he is keenly observant and curious.
- Captain Nemo: Does not appear in this chapter but is mentioned in the context of his scientific charts and the voyage of the Nautilus. He seems solitary and stubborn about his route choices. 

**Story's Beginning:**

- Narrator and companions (Conseil and Ned Land) are recovering on the platform of the Nautilus after being kept underwater for a long time.
- They are breathing in oxygen, and their strength is returning.
- They are alone on the platform â€“ no sign of Captain Nemo or his crew.

**Event Breakdown:**

1. Narrator and companions regain their strength (breathe(Narrator, Conseil, Ned, Oxygen)).
2. They notice they are alone (observe(Narrator, Conseil, Ned, Nautilus, Empty)).
3. Narrator thanks his companions for their help (thank(Narrator, Conseil, Ned)).
4. Ned declares his escape intentions (declare_escape(Ned)).
5. Nautilus heads north (navigate(Nautilus, North)).
6. The submarine cruises the different depths of the sea, visiting various marine fauna and flora (observe_fauna_flora(Nautilus, Marine_life)).
7. Nautilus passes by potential places of refuge without stopping (pass_by(Nautilus, Continental_land)).
8. They fish and catch various sea creatures, including an electric ray that gives Conseil a shock (fish(Nautilus), catch(Nautilus, Fish_species), shock(Conseil, Electric_ray)).
9. They approach the Amazon River's estuary (approach(Nautilus, Amazon_River)).
10. They capture manatees for food storage (catch(Nautilus, Manatees)).
11. They use suckerfish to catch sea turtles (catch(Nautilus, Sea_turtles, Suckerfish)).

**Author's Techniques:**

- "Forecast": This might refer to the anticipatory technique used by the author throughout the chapter. For example, the discussion about the ecological impact of hunting marine predators evokes thoughts about the future, indirectly forecasting potential environmental consequences.
- "Backslash": I'm sorry, but "backslash" in literary analysis is usually a term related to punctuation. If you can provide a clearer context or explanation of what you mean by the use of "backslash" as a literary technique, I'll be able to provide a more accurate response. 

**Literary Tropes:**

- Man vs. Nature: The characters' struggle with survival in an underwater world is a testament to this trope.
- Foil: Conseil and Ned Land often act as foils to the Narrator, highlighting his analytical nature as opposed to, for example, Ned's practicality.
- The Quest: The journey on the Nautilus serves as a continual quest, brimming with exploration and learning.

**Narrative Perspective:**

- The story is narrated from a first-person perspective by the protagonist, who is also the primary observer of the events and discoveries. 
- The perspective does not shift throughout this chapter; all events and observations are filtered through the Narrator's perception.
