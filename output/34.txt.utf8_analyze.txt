Author's Techniques:
"Forecast" would be hard to identify without further knowledge of events in the story. "Backslash" seems not to be a literary term and may be an error in the original question.

Literary Tropes:
1. Dramatic Irony: The readers are aware of the extreme depth and dangers posed by the deep ocean, while the Captain and the crew seem unfazed.
2. Suspense: The author builds suspense at several occasions such as when they are chased by a whaling vessel and when they decide to sink into the greatest known depths of the ocean.
3. Verisimilitude: The passage contains vast marine scientific information, lending credibility and richness to the narrative.
4. Imagery: The vibrant descriptions of the sea fauna, the Gulf Stream, and the Sargasso Sea paints a vivid picture of the underwater world.
5. Foreshadowing: The concern for their dwindling chances of return to civilisation hints at future tribulations.

Narrative Perspective:
The perspective of the story is first-person, seen from the eyes of an observer/narrator aboard the Nautilus. The narrative retains the same perspective throughout the passage without any changes.
