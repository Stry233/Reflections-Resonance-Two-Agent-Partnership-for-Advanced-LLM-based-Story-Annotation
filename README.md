# Automating Story Annotation with Multi-Agent Prompt Generation üìö 

We introduce a **novel multi-agent system** for automating story annotation through the generation of *tailored prompts* for a large language model (LLM). This system utilizes two agents:

1. ü§ñ **Agent A** is responsible for generating prompts that identify the key information necessary for reconstructing the story.
2. ü§ñ **Agent B** reconstructs the story from these annotations and provides feedback to refine the initial prompts.

Human evaluations and perplexity scores revealed that **optimized prompts significantly enhance the model's narrative reconstruction accuracy and confidence**, demonstrating that *dynamic interaction between agents substantially boosts the annotation process's precision and efficiency*. 

Utilizing this innovative approach, we created the `"StorySense"` corpus, containing **615 stories**, meticulously annotated to facilitate comprehensive story analysis. The paper also demonstrates the practical application of our annotated dataset by drawing the story arcs of two distinct stories, showcasing the utility of the annotated information in story structure analysis and understanding.
